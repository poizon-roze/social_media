# social_media
In order to develop my skill in web development,
I decided to create websites.
I start from the simple one (cap),
then I will make the better version in the following ones.

This web is a responsive web where you can find your social media in one page.
This is aimed for people who has limited access to their mobile phone.
In mobile phone they can use provided apps.
But in laptop or desktop it is good to have one page only for social media instead of typing one by one.
I know that this is only one of the alternatives.
But always worth a try.

This is a simple web without any other page such as About Us, etc, etc.
Made by css, html and images are taken from icon8.
I use flex box instead of grid.
This practice gives a good understanding about some css elements such as:
justify-content, margin and align-item.

Had difficulty in hosting since the written instruction is definitely different than the fact.
Took time until the link can be used.
Don't give up!

Enjoy. :-)
